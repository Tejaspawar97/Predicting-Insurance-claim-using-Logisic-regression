# Predicting-Insurance-claim-using-Logisic-regression
 Now in this project, I am going to predict the Insurance claim using logistic regression. This dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policyholders with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

The dataset has details of 1338 Insurance claim with 8 features. You need to predict the Insurance Claim (Yes:1/No:0)

# About the dataset
train.csv
The data file train.csv contains the 1070 instances with the 8 features including the target feature.

test.csv
The datafile test.csv contains the 268instances with the 7 features excluding the target feature.

sample_submission.csv
Explained under the Submission sub-heading

LogisticDataDictionary.csv
The file contains data dictionary(Dictionary explaining what each feature of the dataset means) of the Insurance Claim dataset

# Outcomes

In this project, I applied the following concepts:

EDA & Data Preprocessing
Correlation between the features,
Model Building using Logistic Regression,
logistic regression model.
